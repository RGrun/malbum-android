# malbum-android

This is the Android client component of malbum. It uses JSON to communicate with the
[malbum server](https://github.com/RGrun/malbum-server). Users can access their accounts from
their Android phones, and upload photos to the server.

You can find out more about malbum at its page on my personal site: http://malbum.furu.guru.
